However, DBSCAN can have trouble with clusters that have different densities since it uses fixed values for the `eps` and `min_samples` parameters. **Overall, DBSCAN's capability to manage complex diverse clusters with noise makes it useful choice alongside K-Means, which is a perfect fit for our situation**."

    "Using the default hyperparameters (`min_samples=5` and `eps=0.5`) gave poor results, identifying only 2 noise points (cluster -1) and 3 clusters, which is much less than the expected 7 clusters. This is mainly because the `min_samples` value is not set correctly; it should be at least the dimensionality of the dataset plus 1 (3 + 1). Additionally, the default `eps=0.5` led to too few noise points, while the actual data has around hundreds of noise points, as can be seen visually. The other hyperparameters are better left at their default values.\n",
