    "# Student dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The student dataset is focused on the **education domain**, specifically modeling and predicting academic success. The classification task is to determine whether a first-year college student will pass or fail based on their performance in secondary school and personal learning attributes. The dataset contains **1131 entries** and uses a binary class label, **Pass**, with values of either \"Pass\" or \"Fail.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "The attributes in the dataset are all numeric and represent a mix of academic performance metrics and non-cognitive learning traits. Academic metrics include scores in Mathematics, English, and **CAO Points**, a measure of performance in Ireland's state exams. Non-cognitive traits capture different learning preferences, such as whether a student learns better through listening (**Auditory**), doing (**Kinaesthetic**), or visual aids (**Visual**). Additionally, motivational aspects are reflected through **extrinsic motivation** (driven by external rewards) and **Intrinsic Motivation** (interest in learning). Attributes like **Self-Efficacy** and **Conscientiousness** provide insights into a student's personality and confidence in their abilities, while **Study Time** reflects weekly study habits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset allows for the exploration of how various academic and personal traits influence **a student's likelihood of passing**, highlighting the complex interplay between cognitive skills, personality traits, and study behaviors in academic success.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the adult dataset, the student dataset contains no categorical data. Additionally, all columns have **1131 non-null values**, indicating there are no missing entries. This is advantageous for analysis as it removes the need for data imputation or addressing missing values."
